  "l-diversity": {
    "conceptual_Explanation": "L-diversity is a privacy-enhancing technique that extends k-anonymity by ensuring that sensitive information within each equivalence class is well-represented by at least 'l' distinct values. This helps protect against homogeneity and background knowledge attacks, where sensitive values could still be inferred even with k-anonymity in place.",
    "technical_Explanation": "L-diversity works by modifying the dataset to ensure that, within each group of records that share a common quasi-identifier, there are at least 'l' distinct values for the sensitive attribute. This helps prevent adversaries from linking sensitive information to individuals, by ensuring diversity in the sensitive data for each anonymized group.",

        "description": "The minimum number of records in each group (equivalence class) sharing the same quasi-identifiers to prevent re-identification.",

    "application_Platform": "This technique can be used in data privacy platforms for research, healthcare, and financial data, where sensitive information must be anonymized before sharing.",
    "deployable_Module": "Yes, it can be deployed in privacy-preserving data processing pipelines.",
    "incremental_Updates": "Typically does not support incremental updates, as the entire dataset is often needed to ensure proper l-diversity."
