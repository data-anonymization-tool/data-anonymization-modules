  "k-anonymity": {
    "conceptual_Explanation": "K-anonymity is a privacy model used to prevent re-identification of individuals in datasets. It ensures that each record in the dataset is indistinguishable from at least k-1 other records based on quasi-identifiers, making it difficult to isolate information about any single individual.",
    "technical_Explanation": "K-anonymity is achieved by generalizing or suppressing quasi-identifiers (e.g., age, gender, ZIP code) such that any individual cannot be uniquely identified by their combination of quasi-identifier attributes. This guarantees that each group of individuals shares the same quasi-identifier values, offering a degree of anonymity.",

        "description": "The minimum number of records in each group (equivalence class) sharing the same quasi-identifiers to prevent re-identification.",

    }, 
    "application_Platform": "K-anonymity is widely used in data privacy applications, particularly when anonymizing datasets for release in healthcare, research, or public data-sharing.",
    "deployable_Module": "Yes, it can be deployed in anonymization pipelines where data must be shared while ensuring privacy.",
    "incremental_Updates": "Incremental updates may not be easily supported, as modifying the dataset could compromise the k-anonymity of existing records."
