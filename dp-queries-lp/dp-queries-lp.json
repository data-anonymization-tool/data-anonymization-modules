  "Differentially Private Queries using Laplace": {
    "conceptual_Explanation": "Differentially Private Queries using the Laplace mechanism enable the execution of various data analysis queries on sensitive datasets while preserving the privacy of individuals. This is achieved by adding noise to the results derived from queries, ensuring that the output remains informative but not revealing of individual data points.",
    "technical_Explanation": "The Laplace mechanism introduces noise generated from the Laplace distribution to the results of specified queries. This noise is determined by the privacy parameter, Îµ (epsilon), and the sensitivity of the query. In the implementation, each query is processed to evaluate its output, followed by the addition of Laplace noise. This ensures that the output maintains differential privacy, meaning the inclusion or exclusion of any single individual's data has a negligible impact on the output of the query.",
